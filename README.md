# RandomForestClassifier and XGBoost - Heart Disease Prediction

This project applies three machine learning algorithms to a heart disease dataset:

- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

### 📁 Files

- `heart_prediction.py`: Main script including all model training and evaluation.
- `heart.zip`: Dataset (make sure to place it in the same directory).

### 📊 Dataset

The dataset is a heart disease dataset with various clinical features and a target variable `output` (0 or 1).

### 🧪 Models Used

- **Decision Tree**: Trained and visualized with `graphviz`.
- **Random Forest**: Tuned with `max_depth`, `n_estimators`, and `criterion`.
- **XGBoost**: With test/train split and full training accuracy.

### 📈 Results

You can run the script and check the printed accuracy scores in the console.
